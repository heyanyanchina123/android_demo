                        Our estimates are for informational purposes only. The App is not a medical device. Do not rely solely on
                        the App for critical health decisions. Results may vary based on image quality and other factors.

                    <p>
                        You retain rights to content you upload, but grant us a license to use it for operating and improving the
                        App. We may use food images you submit to improve our AI technology. Do not submit content that is
                        illegal, infringes on rights, or is offensive.

                        at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. App Store transactions are managed by Google, and
